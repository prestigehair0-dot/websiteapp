## Booking flow

`BookingProvider` holds all booking state; the drawer mounts only while open.
Steps: **1** service + stylist → **2** date + time → **3** details →
**4** confirmation. Selections persist between openings; the step resets.

State is local only — there is no backend. To make it real, replace:

- `src/lib/booking.ts` — the placeholder catalogue and prices
- `upcomingDates()` / `TIMES` — with live availability from staff schedules
- the step 3 "Pay deposit" action — with a Stripe payment intent
- `bookingReference()` — with the reference returned by the booking API
- "Add to calendar" on step 4 — currently just closes the drawer

## Placeholders

Photography is rendered as striped blocks (`stripe-warm` / `stripe-deep` in
`globals.css`), stylists are unnamed, and prices and opening hours are
placeholders pending the verified salon data — all as flagged in the design.

## Integrations

### Stripe payments (`/api/checkout`, `/api/stripe/webhook`)

The booking funnel opens a Stripe Checkout session. Step 3 offers two options:

- **Secure a deposit** — authorises a deposit hold (`capture_method: manual`),
  captured only once the studio approves the appointment.
- **Pay in full** — charges the full service price immediately.

The `checkout.session.completed` webhook emails the client (and
`BOOKINGS_EMAIL`) their confirmation via Resend, reflecting which option was
chosen.

### Calendly + calendar links (`/api/calendar`, `src/lib/calendly.ts`)

- **Add to calendar** — `/api/calendar` returns an RFC 5545 `.ics` for the
  requested slot (Europe/London), linked from the success page and the
  confirmation email.
- **Book a consultation** — a Calendly link (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY_URL`) is
  surfaced on the homepage, the success page and the email, pre-filled with the
  client's name and email where known.

### Memberships & programmes (`/memberships`, `src/lib/memberships.ts`)

Five structured programmes (Cleanse & Sculpt Quarterly Reset, Texture Release
Longevity & Silk Club, Ultimate Transitioning & Restorative Journey,
Bio-Pilixin® Cellular Restore, Healthy Scalp & Growth Detox) are defined in
`src/lib/memberships.ts` — the single source of truth for pricing.

The journey is **Discover → Compare → Hair tier → Payment → Purchase → Book Visit 1**:

- The homepage promotes them in a dedicated section, and **Memberships &
  Programmes** is in the main nav.
- `/memberships` shows premium cards with a `SHORT | MEDIUM | LONG` tier
  selector, a `PAY IN FULL | MONTHLY` payment selector and a live price, plus
  full per-programme details. A sticky mobile CTA ("Join a membership — from …")
  keeps the action in reach.
- Each **JOIN** deep-links to `/memberships/join?programme=…&tier=…&payment=…`,
  which collects details and starts Stripe Checkout via
  `/api/checkout/membership` — `mode: payment` for pay-in-full, `mode:
  subscription` (monthly recurring, instalment count in metadata) for a plan.
- After payment, `/memberships/success` confirms the membership, shows a
  read-only account snapshot (active programme, visits, payment plan) and a
  **Book Visit 1** CTA into the booking funnel. The confirmation email carries
  the same. Included visits are prepaid, so the client isn't charged again for a
  covered service.

### Instalment plans & billing lifecycle (`src/lib/stripe/billing.ts`)

Monthly plans (£x × N) are Checkout **subscriptions** — Stripe can't cap a
subscription's length at creation, so the term is enforced by the webhook:

- `invoice.paid` marks the membership `active`, and once **N** paid invoices
  have been collected (N from subscription metadata) the subscription is
  **cancelled** — the customer is charged exactly N times. Counting paid
  invoices (rather than a local tally) keeps it idempotent under webhook retries.
- `invoice.payment_failed` → `past_due`; `customer.subscription.deleted` →
  `cancelled` (unless the term already `completed`); `customer.subscription.updated`
  maps Stripe's status onto the membership.

The webhook is a `switch` that 500s (so Stripe retries) only on handler errors;
all handlers are idempotent, and confirmation emails are fault-isolated so a mail
hiccup never triggers a retry that could re-send.

### Membership account (`/account`, `/sign-in`)

Members sign in passwordlessly (Supabase email OTP at `/sign-in`) to a dashboard
at `/account`:

- The Stripe webhook writes each purchase to the `memberships` table (migration
  `0014_memberships.sql`), linking the buyer's profile by email where one exists.
- On dashboard load, any guest purchases made with the signed-in email are
  claimed to the account, then read back under RLS (a customer sees only their
  own rows; staff read all; managers may correct visit counts).
- The dashboard shows, per programme: status, **appointments N / total**,
  **remaining visits**, **next appointment**, and **payment plan**, with **Book
  Next Visit**, **Reschedule** and **View membership** (Stripe billing portal for
  subscriptions via `/api/stripe/portal`) actions.
- `src/middleware.ts` refreshes the Supabase session on each request;
  `/auth/sign-out` ends it. **My account** is in the main nav, and the success
  page + confirmation email link to `/account`.

### Prepaid membership visits

Included visits are prepaid and booked without any charge:

- From `/account`, **Book Next Visit** / **Reschedule** open `/account/book?m=<id>`
  (`requireUser`-gated). The member picks a slot; **£0 is due**.
- `/api/membership/visit` verifies ownership server-side, checks a visit is
  still available (`canBookVisit`), and records the requested slot in
  `next_visit_at` — no Stripe involved. A confirmation email goes out marked
  "Included in your membership — no charge".
- Staff advance the counter with `/api/membership/complete` (managers only),
  which increments `completed_visits`, clears the booked slot, and marks the
  membership `completed` once every included visit is used.
- Europe/London wall-clock times are stored with the correct BST/GMT offset
  (`src/lib/memberships/visits.ts`).

### CRM email distribution (`/api/crm/distribution`)

Sends a consent-aware marketing broadcast to clients with
`profiles.marketing_email = true`. Every send is logged to
`message_deliveries` with an idempotency key of `campaign:<id>:<profile>`, so a
re-run resumes rather than double-mails. Authenticated with the `CRON_SECRET`
Bearer token; supports `testRecipients` and `dryRun`.

```bash
curl -X POST "$APP_URL/api/crm/distribution" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaignId":"autumn-2026","subject":"Autumn hair, refreshed",
       "heading":"A new season for your hair",
       "bodyHtml":"<p>Hi {{firstName}}, book your autumn refresh…</p>"}'
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe checkout + webhook |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Transactional and campaign email |
| `BOOKINGS_EMAIL` | The salon inbox — booking/membership notifications + reply-to (defaults to prestigehair0@gmail.com) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Authenticates `/api/crm/distribution` and cron routes |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | App origin, used for absolute links in emails |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY_URL` | Consultation booking link (default: the connected account's 30-min event) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CALENDLY_SCHEDULING_URL` | The Calendly account page |

## Design source

`project/Prestige Hair Society.dc.html` is the original Claude Design prototype
and `chats/` holds the design conversation. Both are kept for reference; they
are not part of the build (`project/` is excluded from linting).
